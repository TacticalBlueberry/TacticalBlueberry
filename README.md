- 👋 Hi, I’m @TacticalBlueberry
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Learning how to code, program, anything someone aspiring to be a software engineer should learn and know.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Everything from square one.  It's a lot to take in, but I'm excited and will take my time learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Anything and everything once I get going on what I need to learn.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Will update further down the line once I'm more acclimated to all this.
